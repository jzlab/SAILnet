# SAILnet

## Project Description
The Sparse And Independent Local network (SAILnet) is a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that uses synaptically local plasticity rules to learn sparse representations of natural images

SAILnet is a putative model of the mammalian visual cortex, and improves over (previously) existing models by being more biophysically realistic.

The model, and its relevance to neurobiology, are described in our 2011 PLoS Computational Biology paper
[A Sparse Coding Model with Synaptically Local Plasticity and Spiking Neurons Can Account for the Diverse Shapes of V1 Simple Cell Receptive Fields](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002250).

We also used the model to explore how sparseness changes during development (in model systems), in our 2013 PLoS Computational Biology paper [Sparse Coding Models Can Exhibit Decreasing Sparseness while Learning Sparse Codes for Natural Images](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003182).
